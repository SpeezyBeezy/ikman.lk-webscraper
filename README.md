# ikman.lk-webscraper
A simple web scraper to export the product title, product price, ad link, upload time, and selling location from ikman.lk to a CSV file

## Features
- Extracts:
  - Title
  - Price
  - Link
  - Time listed
  - Location (category prefix removed, e.g. "Mobile Phones").
- Skips promoted/featured ads.
- Writes rows live into CSV (flush + fsync).
- Optional configurable delay between pages (default = 0, "ruthless mode").
- Command line input for start URL and number of pages.

## Requirements
Install dependencies with:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Dependencies used:
- beautifulsoup4
- requests
- tqdm

(Other modules are from Pythonâ€™s standard library.)

## Usage
Run the scraper:

    python ikman webscraper.py

You will be prompted to enter:
1. The start URL (e.g. `https://ikman.lk/en/ads/sri-lanka/mobile-phones`) (I made it this way so user could search for something, add filters and paste the url bar link straight into the scraper)  
2. The number of pages to scrape. (ikman.lk loops back to first page after 400+ pages so if you wanna scrape as much pages as possible enter maximum of 400 pages) 

Output will be saved as:

    phones_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.csv
